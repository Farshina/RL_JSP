Title: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Dynamic Job Scheduling Problem
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9955328

This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning approach for solving the Job Scheduling Problem in a dynamic environment with an aim to minimize the peak instantaneous electricity consumption. The training instance is randomly reset after a certain period and the solver uses online training to adapt to the new environment.
